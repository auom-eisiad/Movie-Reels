# Movie-Reels

## Description

Movie-Reels is an application that allows users to search for movie titles and find info about them. (ie. Movie Poster, Plot, Reviews from Critics, Trailer)
Then users can add that title to a watchlsit to reference later.

- Motivation: At present there are so many options to watch.  Just sitting down to view something for leisure can be a trudge.
     Having a "grocery list" can help save time previously wasted searching so people can get back to watching what they want instead of wasting
      free time. 
- Why did you build this project? All members of our group are passionate about movies and television and very much try to maximzie our time spent viewing as well as talking and sharing about them.
- What problem does it solve? It is both a time saver and a convenient place to store movie titles for oneself.
- What did you learn?

    ```

## Credits

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
